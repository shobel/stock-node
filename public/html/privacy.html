<h5>Security</h5>
 We have put in place certain safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access and maintain data security with respect to your Personal Data. Despite these protections, however, we cannot guarantee that your data will be 100% secure. You should take measures to protect your Personal Data.

Your online access to your Personal Data may be protected with a password you select. We will never ask you for your password in any unsolicited communication. You have an obligation to keep your user ID, password and personal information secure. As part of maintaining this obligation we recommend you do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Keep your user ID and password confidential</li>
  <li>Utilize a unique password and change it frequently</li>
  <li>Make sure others are not watching you enter your user ID and/or password on your keyboard or mobile phone</li>
  <li>Do not leave your computer or mobile phone unattended while logged on. After you finished accessing your information, exit the protected area</li>
  <li>Logout when not using the app</li>
</ul>
 </p>
